				<PageHeader>Welcome to CWRC-Writer<br/><small>The XML & RDF online editor developed by the <a href="https://cwrc.ca" rel="noopener noreferrer">Canadian Writing Research Collaboratory</a></small></PageHeader>
				<p>CWRC-Writer provides:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>schema-aware document editing, including validation, against web-accessible schemas</li>
					<li>support for cascading stylesheets (CSS) to provide a WYSIWYG view of documents, as well as a view showing tags</li>
					<li>ability to look up and select identifiers for named entity tags (persons, organization, places, or titles) from a range of Linked Open Data authorities</li>
					<li>generation (if desired) of Linked Data annotations corresponding to tags for named entities and document annotations (notes, citations, corrections, links) in XML-RDF or JSON-LD conforming to the Web Annotation Data Model, for both pre-existing and newly added tags</li>
					<li>ability to detect candidate named entities (persons, places, or organizations) within a document for tagging and/or Web Annotation, to evaluate and refine those suggestions, and to associate the entities with LOD identifiers</li>
				</ul>
				<p>This version of CWRC-Writer, <em>Git-Writer</em>, uses the GitHub repository for document storage, versioning, and sharing. You need to be logged into a GitHub account to use it.</p>
				<p>Git-Writer is designed to work with customizations of the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) schema provided by the TEI Consortium. (Schemas/CSS must be available at an https:// location and have CORS enabled.)</p>
				<p>You can use CWRC-Writer to edit XML documents or produce new documents from templates. There are templates and sample documents here for getting started. Producing Linked Open Data annotations is optional.</p>
